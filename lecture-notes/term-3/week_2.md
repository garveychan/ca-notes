### JavaScript

Four Pillars of JavaScript

1. Datatype Coercion
2. Prototypical Inheritance (and Classes)
	f.prototype; o.__proto__; Object.getPrototypeof(o)
3. Dynamic and Lexical `this`
4. Functions and Closures
5. Asynchronous Code - Callbacks, Promises, and Async

### Asynchronous Code

Call Stack - Thread of Execution

### Promises

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises
- Good guide for promises

'You don't know JavaScript - Kyle Simpson'
https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
- Intermediate/Advanced JavaScript Books
- Considered 'bibles' in the industry

JavaScript - The Definitive Guide - O'Reilly
- The 'bible' of the language, good to know if pursuing a career with JS

Good to be familiar with the 'bible' of whichever technology being pursued for career

### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation - sent as string, resembles an object.
'Keys' in object must always be strings enclosed with double quotes "".

### Web APIs

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
Good to explore the APIs available to web developers.
e.g. HTML Drag and Drop as an API.
 
XMLHttpRequest was the historical way of fetching information from the web.
The underlying functions form the basis of modern Web APIs which are more intuitive and efficient to use.

https://axios-http.com/
Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
Good to be aware of this - likely to be used if dealing with server-side JavaScript.

Polyfill

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

Fetch
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
The Fetch API provides an interface accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline - such as requests and responses.
It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
