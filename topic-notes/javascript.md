### Background

"JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behaviour on most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run."

### Read/Eval/Print/Loop

**Node.js**

"REPL also known as Read Evaluate Print Loop is a programming language environment (basically a console window) that takes single expression as user input and returns the result back to the console after execution."

`node` in terminal to open.
`.exit` to close.
`Ctrl+L` to clear terminal.

### Background

#### What is JavaScript (JS)?

- Dynamically-typed
- Interpreted or just-in-time Compiled
- Natively understood by web browsers
- Syntax inspired by C/C++/Java
- Runs on both client-side (browser) and server-side (NodeJS)
- All modern web developers should be proficient at JS

#### History

- Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich who co-founded Mozilla
- Unrelated to popular programming language Java
- Several decisions around the design of the language were made for political reasons rather than technical reasons

#### JS in the Browser

- The implementation of JavaScript code in browsers is very similar to CSS code - it can be *inline*, *within the HTML code*, or *embedded as an external file*.

```HTML
<script src="filename.js"></script>
```

- When the browser parses the HTML file and reaches the `script` tag, it requests the script file from the server and interprets that as well - much like with Cascading Style Sheets.
- The JS code will then be executed on the client-side.
- It is recommended that the JS code be confined to the embedded file so that the code is more maintainable.

##### Execution

- With `.js` script files in the browser, there is no 'main' method - the script file is executed from top to bottom.
- There is also no prior compilation - The browser compiles and executes the code on the fly - just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
